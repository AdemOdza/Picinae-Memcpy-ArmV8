# common

average execution time is usually 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than predicted WCET

results are wildly variable, up to 3 orders of magnitude difference between runs.
Likely due to variability in hardware runtimes

# collatz

Rapitime completely locks up even with loop annotations, seemingly can't handle so many deep loops that iterate so many times

# arraysearch



## Proofs

while_true_break: 5 hours
cache proof: 30 minutes
collatz: 3 hours (excluding linearity problem)
insert_after_pos_in_list: 3 hours
